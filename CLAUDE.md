# Workflow

-   Be sure to run `bun run check` whenever you modify files under the frontend directory.
-   Be sure to run `forge fmt --check` whenever you modify Solidity contracts or tests.

# Frontend Notes

-   When importing a module, first check whether it’s already configured for auto-import in vite.config.ts. If it is, you don’t need to import it manually.
